# Second-Semester-Data
My Second semester source code and all the course relate materials
I thought i have lost all my previous semester data when my ubantu operating system was not working and then i tried my best to retrive the data.
Finally today i made a bootable usb and opned the laptop. THen i accessed the root files and from hard disk i pulled all the second semester code. So my advice to every programmer at any stage of his career is to use Version Control system so that he or she will not lose his/her data. And Even colaborating is easy and efficient through version controls like git. I always guide my juniors and fellows to use github :)
